# 🧡 Mikiverse

**Mikiverse** is a playful VS Code extension where **Miki** quietly observes your general flow  
and reacts with small, encouraging messages.

It’s designed to make programming more fun, motivating, and a little less lonely —  
without being distracting.

> *“Hey, it’s Miki. Observing everything.”*
